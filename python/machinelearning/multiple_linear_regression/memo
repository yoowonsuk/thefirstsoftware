coefficient
correlation -1, 1 or 0

P-Values
R-Squared
Adj R-Squared

null hypothesis
So for example in case of a coin, our null hypothesis might be that the coin is a fair coin

Alternative Hypothesis: It's the opposite of or rejection of null hypothesis e.g in case of a coin we might reject our claim and say that the coin is not a fair coin

p-value : probability
ex) e-value < 0.001 reject the null hypothesis
(significant value = 0.001)


remove non-sense variables
correlation
multi-collinearity (between indepentent variables) => redundant

dummy variables
