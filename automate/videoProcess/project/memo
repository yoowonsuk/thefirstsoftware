Project Requirements
Project description

Your task for this project is to write a program that reads a video and censors peoples' faces in the video replacing them with cat faces. You have a sample video attached to the resources. Once you write the program, consider sharing it with other students. You can copy-paste the code in the course QA forum.

Project Solution 2: Censoring Faces Using Filled Rectangles
Another solution would be to draw filled rectangles on top of the video. The code below the picture does just that.


Project Solution 3: Censoring Faces Using a Cat Face
Another solution would be to overlay an image (e.g., a cat face on top of the human face). You can find the code for that below the picture.
