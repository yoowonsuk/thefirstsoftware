Project Requirements
For this project, your task is to create a program that takes as input words in English and returns the definitions of those words. The program should have a desktop GUI. Here are a few things to note:

1. You can use PyQt6 for the GUI using the knowledge you got in the Web Apps and Desktop GUI Apps section.

2. You can use the word definition program that we built previously in the Miscellaneous section to find the definitions of words.

3. You can use the attached JSON dataset to get the definitions of English words.

The app can look like below (or better):
